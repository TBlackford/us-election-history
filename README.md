# US Election History

This is a rewrite of a previous project I did years ago that can be found [here](https://github.com/TBlackford/ElectionHistories).

There are the following services:
- `frontend` - the frontend for the website. I couldn't think of a good name for this.
- `chronicle-api` - this holds the API for US election data.
- `cartographer-api` - this is for US map data. It mostly redirects to a forked github repo I made, however, I intend to also have this return geobuf data from an S3 bucket
